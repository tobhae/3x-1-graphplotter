# 3x + 1, the problem
3x + 1, or the Collatz Conjecture, is a famous and "simple" problem in mathematics which can't be solved. \
The rules are simple: If the number is even, divide it by 2. If the number is uneven, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat for next number.\
So far every number tested will go down to 1, where in the next iteration it will go upp to 4, then back to 2 and lastly 1 again. \
At this point we're stuck in a loop. Mathematicians is trying to find a number that won't go down to 1.\
